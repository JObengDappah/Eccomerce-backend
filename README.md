## Description

This project is designed as a backend solution for an e-commerce website. It employs Sequelize for database setup and management, handling information about products, categories, and tags. Through Express routes, the project enables viewing, adding, updating, and deleting database entries. Additionally, it integrates the dotenv package to manage environment variables for database configuration. Below is a link to a video that demonstrates the API routes being tested in Insomnia.
